## Tips:
* If you don't have acces to an independent Linux machine, buy an external HD, it simplifies the process.
* You'll need a USB, saldy you can't download it like RAM
* Install the distro distribution ROS is build on. Surely you can install a downgrade, but don't complicate things.
* If your system has both Windows and Linux, from the [settings](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1083369/ubuntu-18-04-cannot-recognize-intel-wireless-ac-9260) disable fast start up
* Install VSCode
